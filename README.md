# soil-salinity

This project combines California farmland vector data and satellite soil salinity data and displays the result in an interactive web interface.

## Features

- Aggregation function selection (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation)
- Raster data selection
- Interactive farmland data front-end interface
- Dynamic extents

## Installation

### Dependencies

The soil salinity backend relies upon Java 1.8.0 and Scala 2.12.7.

### Setup

This project expects all data files (shapefile, GeoTIFF) to be stored in the `data/` directory.
The data directory should be organized as follows:

![data directory](directory_organization.png)

### Server deployment

Use the command `mvn clean package` to generate a WAR file in the `target/` directory.
The file should be named `raptor-backend-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war`.
To deploy this generated WAR file, simply copy it to the `webapps/` folder of your Apache Tomcat installation directory.
